# XYZ Reader
A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines provided by Udacity for the fifth stage (Material Design for Android Developers) of Android Nanodegree Program.

XYZ Reader was evaluated and graded as "Meets Specifications" (the highest grade for this project) by certified Udacity code reviewer.

## Project Overview

The main objective of the project was to redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. This involved followings:
* Application of Material Design guidelines
* Separation of an interface into surfaces
* Effective use of transitions and motion

## Why this Project?

This project gave me an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicated a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
